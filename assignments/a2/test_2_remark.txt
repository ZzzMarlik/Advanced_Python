                 CSC 148H -- Winter 2017: REQUEST TO RE-MARK TEST
                 ================================================


  Student number: 1002376555     Lecture section: Lec0101


  Last name:      Zhang     Instructor:      Danny Heap


  First name:     Make     


  Email address:  make.zhang@mail.utoronto.ca     


  Test number: Term Test 2 - morning     Date of request: March 22 2017


Concisely, and clearly, state what portion of the test was not
correctly marked.

For Question 2, I have showed my answer to our professor Heap, and he said this is correct and ask me to send remark request. And one more important thing is the mark that Ta gave me is what I lost for this question. Not the mark I earned. i.e. The total mark for Q2 is 6, and he only gives me 1.5 which is the mark I lost.
